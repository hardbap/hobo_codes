Hobo Codes is a way for freelancers and consultants to leave markers in code
for those who may follow them. It's called 'Hobo Codes' because during the
Great Depression hobos used to leave cryptic marks on fenceposts and walls
alerting their fellow vagabonds about things like whether the residents of a
particular house were willing to give food in exchange for work.
